# Module which map services to back-ends, with ability to redirect
# clients to a particular back-end node for 10 minutes at a time.
#
# The module reads an external mapping table which maps URL regexps
# to "|"-separated list of back-end hosts. Each such rule can have
# additional :attributes attached to it. The exact rule syntax is:
#
#   REGEXP HOST[|HOST]... [:ATTRIBUTE]
#
# White space in beginning and end of lines is ignored. After that
# any empty lines and lines beginning with "#" are ignored. The rest
# must be rules conforming to the syntax shown above. Apart for the
# attributes this is mostly like Apache's external rewrite map.
#
# The REGEXP specifies pattern to match against the unparsed URI.
# Normally it should be anchored to beginning: "^/dqm(?:/.*)?$".
#
# The "|"-separated list specifies back-end hosts the service will be
# sent to. One is selected in round-robin random series.
#
# If the rule has trailing :affinity attribute, then clients will be
# sent a cookie to remember the selected host. Subsequent accesses
# from the same client will use the cookie provided it is still valid.
#
# If :affinity is enabled, the mapping to back-end hosts is done with
# consistent hashing lookup: the cookie stores a hash of the previous
# server choice, and we'll keep going to the same host as long as it
# is available in the server map. If the server list changes so that
# the previous host is no longer available, the request will be sent
# to some other host instead.
#
# Hence when processing the service host list, we create a hash table
# of the host names, with 500 hashed versions of each candidate as is
# customary for consistent hashing to achieve even distribution. The
# hash list is sorted by increasing hash order by hash hex string.
#
# When looking for a match by the hash, i.e. from 'cms-node' affinity
# cookie, we scan the list of hashes for that service from beginning
# until we find a hash not less than the incoming hash, or we reach
# the end of the list. The server for that hash will satisfy this
# and future requests from the client.
#
# Usually the selected server will be the one the client used before,
# and the hashes will compare equal. If the server list changes, we
# may choose a different server. As long as previously used server
# remains on the list, it will continue to be selected by the hash.
# Either way, the same choice will be made consistently as long as
# the server list remains unchanged.
#
# The affinity cookie is has the following structure, with all the
# fields being lowercase hex characters, 88 characters in total:
# - 1..8: unix epoch timestamp when cookie was created
# - 9..48: hash for the back-end server to use
# - 49..88: sha1 hmac over 1..48 plus secret signing key
#
# Note that the cookie has a hmac which prevents clients from setting
# a valid cookie. The client cannot construct a server selection even
# if they knew which back-end host they wanted to get to. The cookie
# is only set only when needed. All processing happens as the request
# passes through, there are no extra round-trips to the client.
