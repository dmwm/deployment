# CMSWEB authentication and authorisation module.
#
# This module is set up in Apache in /auth URL space. Requests to the
# protected applications are sent here as internal redirections using
# Apache rewrite engine (mod_rewrite). The module authenticates the
# client. If authentication is mandatory and the client cannot be
# verified, access is denied. Otherwise access is allowed and HTTP
# request headers are modified to report authentication information.
#
# If authentication succeeds, the users' roles are retrieved from the
# CMS authorisation database (SiteDB), although this happens via an
# intermediary JSON file so the httpd server isn't dependent on the
# database availability. If the user is known and has authorisation
# roles, the information is added to the HTTP request headers. The
# back-end apps should use the information from headers to determine
# actions applicable to the user.
#
# Any authn/authz headers present in the original HTTP request are
# always completely removed. The module adds headers based on the
# authn/authz results, and adds HMAC of the added headers so the
# back-ends can verify the integrity of the information.
#
# When a request arrives in Apache, application proxy rules should
# set AUTH_SPEC environment variable to the app authentication and
# authorisation options, and rewrite the entire URI including any
# query string to begin with /auth/verify. If authentication is
# completed, the request is rewritten to /auth/complete followed
# by the full original URI, including any query string arguments.
# The real proxy rules should be attached there. If authentication
# fails, the URI is reset to the original location and processing is
# terminated with 403 Forbidden.
#
# AUTH_SPEC should be semi-colon separated list of authentication
# options. The entries are processed in the order given, and the
# first option to satisfy the authentication is taken. If the
# module reaches the end of the list, the authentication fails.
# The possible options are:
#
#  cert
#
#   Allow accesses by X509 grid certificate or a proxy thereof. Only
#   certificates which are CMS VO members or on a special exemption
#   list of known important service certificates are accepted.
#
#  limited-proxy
#
#   Add this option to also permit limited proxies in addition to the
#   normal certificates and proxies allowed by 'cert'.
#
#  host
#
#   Allow certain hosts based on IP address exemption list. This is
#   the weakest possible authentication method and should only grant
#   viewing rights to relatively non-sensitive information. The IP
#   list maintains known CMS centre monitoring stations at various
#   locations around the world. In some cases there is no possibility
#   for a human to interact with the station, and no meaningful
#   authentication is possible.
#
#  aucookie
#
#   This method is for legacy support. The 'cert' method sets bogus
#   cookie which can later be handed back to the server without a
#   certificate. The server will know the access is valid, but does
#   not record who the access was by, so authorisation will be void.
#
#  optional
#
#   Marks the entire authentication optional, access is allowed even
#   if none of the authentication methods succeed. The application
#   must be aware that requests may come from unidentified non-CMS
#   clients. Use this if only certain parts of the application are
#   sensitive and the application performs additional protection.
#
#  authz=off
#
#   Authenticate but disable authorisation, presumably because the
#   application has no use for the information. Use this if the app
#   should be restricted to CMS users only, but does not perform any
#   meaningful actions, for example offers no modification ability.
#
#  roles=<regexp>
#
#   This option may be specified repeatedly. Each specification adds
#   a regular expression filter to include only certain roles to the
#   back-end authorisation lists. Use this to tell the application
#   only about roles the application needs to know about. The perl
#   regular expression must match the entire role string. The regexps
#   form an union: if any regexp matches, the result is included into
#   the HTTP request headers. This filter is applied before the group
#   filter.
#
#  groups=<regexp>
#
#   This option may be specified repeatedly. Each specification adds
#   a regular expression filter to include only certain groups to the
#   back-end authorisation lists. Use this to tell the application
#   only about roles and groups the application needs to know about.
#   The perl regular expression must match the entire group string.
#   The regexps form an union: if any regexp matches, the result is
#   included into the HTTP request headers. Note that site groups are
#   of the form site:name, regular groups group:name. If all groups
#   of a role are filtered out, the entire CMS-AuthZ header for that
#   role is suppressed.
#
# The module sets the following headers in the HTTP request:
#
#  CMS-Auth-Status
#
#   Presence of this header indicates the request came over SSL and
#   was authenticated. The value is "OK" if authentication succeeded,
#   "NONE" otherwise. If authentication is mandatory the value is
#   always "OK" as access is denied if the client authentication
#   fails. Hence "NONE" is possible only if the service has been
#   configured to with optional authentication.
#
#  CMS-AuthN-Method
#
#   The value of this header indicates how the client was identified,
#   as listed below. The header is present always if authentication
#   has been enabled for the application in the front-end.
#
#     X509Cert   Client used fully verified X509 grid certificate
#                and the DN is a member of CMS VO.
#
#     X509Proxy  Client used fully verified X509 grid certificate
#                proxy, whose main DN is a member of CMS VO.
#
#     X509LimitedProxy
#                Client used fully verified X509 grid certificate
#                *LIMITED* proxy, whose main DN is a member of CMS VO.
#                Applications should not necessarily grant these the
#                same powers as X509Proxy as the proxy may have been
#                harvested from a worker node. Note that this value is
#                possible only if 'limited-proxy' is active on service.
#
#     HostIP     Client IP address was exempted from authentication
#                and no stronger authentication method applied.
#
#     AUCookie   Client handed back a token from previous X509Cert
#                authentication. For legacy support only.
#
#     None       Client was not identified but authentication was
#                optional so the access was permitted.
#
#  CMS-AuthN-DN
#
#   The value of this header is the DN of the client's X509 cert. It
#   is always present when CMS-AuthN-Method is X509Cert/(Limited)Proxy.
#   This string is UTF-8.
#
#  CMS-AuthN-Login
#
#   The value of this header is the CMS hypernew login of the client.
#   It is present if CMS-AuthN-Method is X509Cert/(Limited)Proxy and 
#   SiteDB has DN account association. This string is ASCII.
#
#  CMS-AuthN-Name
#
#   The value of this header is the SiteDB registered forename and
#   surname of the client. It may not be present if the fields have
#   not been recorded in SiteDB. If authentication method is HostIP
#   or None, this header is not present. This string is UTF-8.
#
#  CMS-AuthZ-<Role>
#
#   A header for each role the client has, with space separated list
#   of group:name and site:name the role applies to. Note that all of
#   the entities -- roles, groups and sites -- are in canonical form
#   where the permitted letters are lowercase letters a-z, numbers
#   and the dash "-". All other characters are converted to "-" and
#   consecutive dashes are collapsed to one dash. This string is ASCII.
#
#  CMS-AuthN-HMAC
#
#   SHA1 HMAC over all authentication and authorisation headers. The
#   HMAC is computed from a secret key shared with back-ends and a
#   string made from all the headers and their values.
#
#   In order to compute or verify the HMAC, take all the HTTP request
#   headers, not including trailing \r\n characters, lowercase the
#   header names, and keep all headers beginning with "cms-authn" or
#   "cms-authz" except "cms-authn-hmac". Sort these headers into
#   alphabetically ascending order (a .. z) by header name.
#
#   Build a prefix of the header data by concatenating the strings
#   h<hexnum>v<hexnum> in header sorted order, where the hexnum are
#   the length of the header name and its value in lowercase hex,
#   respectively. Append one "#" character, followed by the header
#   names and values, again in header sorted order.
#
#   Compute SHA1 HMAC of this string with the secret key. Convert the
#   HMAC to a hex string, two lowercase hex characters per byte, 40
#   characters in total. If the resulting string compares byte for
#   byte equal with the CMS-AuthN-HMAC header value, the application
#   can trust the authentication and authorisation header values.
#   Since string consists of hexadecimal letters, it's always ASCII.
#
#  CMS-Auth-Host
#  CMS-Auth-Cert
#
#   These are legacy headers and should not be used in new apps.
#
# The module may also request the client to set a "cms-auth" cookie.
# For legacy reasons the cookie is set on X509 certificate accesses.
#
# Configuration parameters:
#  AUTH_HMAC_KEYS     Directory containing secret keys for HMAC signatures.
#  AUTH_HOST_EXEMPT   List of files with exempted host ip-address name pairs.
#  AUTH_GRID_MAPS     List of files with additional cert VO memberships.
#  AUTH_REVOKED       List of files containing revoked users.
#  AUTH_JSON_MAP      File containing SiteDB authn/authz info from mkauthmap.
