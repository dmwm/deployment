    <h2>Help and Support</h2>
    <p>Planned CMSWEB downtimes are listed in the
       <a href='https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/ScheduledInterventions'>scheduled interventions</a> page.
       These interventions and other CMSWEB important issues and changes are reported in the
       <a href='https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/cernCompAnnounce.html'>CERN computing announcements</a> forum.
    </p>
    <p>To authenticate against CMSWEB services, you must be properly
       <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideLcgAccess">registered</a> with CMS.
       The <a href="https://cmsweb.cern.ch/auth/trouble/">trouble-shooting</a> page helps you to
       diagnose certificate authentication problems. Please also check your
       certificate is properly mapped to your account in
       <a href="/sitedb/prod/mycert">SiteDB</a>.
    </p>
    <p>If you constantly having your browser complaining this site is not trusted (and need to confirm an exception),
       it means you don't have the CERN Grid CA certificates properly installed. Please follow the instructions
       <a href="https://cafiles.cern.ch/cafiles/certificates/Grid.aspx">here</a>. If you had it already installed,
       make sure you have marked all the "Trust this CA to..." check boxes as the instructions tell.
    </p>
    <p>Some services may additionally require you to have specific <a href="https://cmsweb.cern.ch/sitedb/prod/admin">roles</a>
       in SiteDB to allow you to access some functions or features. Look for
       them in the respective service help pages and follow corresponding instructions.
       If you don't know where to request or find information about, ask the cms-service-webtools CERN e-group.
    </p>
    <p>For CMSWEB services API documentation, see 
       <a href="https://cms-http-group.web.cern.ch/cms-http-group/apidoc/">apidocs</a>.
    </p>
    <p>For reporting bugs or any other CMSWEB problems, please open a
       <a href="https://ggus.eu/?mode=ticket_cms">ticket</a> and assign it to "CMS Web Tools" Support Unit.
